Q. Create an algorithm that contains a sequential list of steps and a stepwise refinement process for something that you do in a day to day basis. 

Ans.  Algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

Preparing a cup of tea: 

Sequential list of steps:
1. Grab tea preparation equipments.
2. Fill the kettle with half a cup of water.
3. Boil the Kettle.
4. Pour Water.
5. Position the tea bag on the cup. 
6. Add milk.
7. Dink.
8. Cleanup after yourself.

Stepwise refinement process:

1. Grab tea preparation equipments:
  a. Open the cupboard
  b. Grab a kettle, cup, tea bag and a spoon
  c. Place the equipmets we just grabbed on the kitchen counter
  d. Close the cupboard
  e. Open the fridge
  f. Grab the bottle of milk and place it in the counter
  g. close the fridge

2. Fill the Kettle:
  a. Take the kettle that was placed in the counter
  b. Place it under the tap on the sink 
  c. Open the tap
  d. Fill the kettle halfway through
  e. Close the tap

3. Boil the Kettle:
  a. Take the kettle and plug it to the outlet
  b. Turn the kettle on 
  c. Wait for the water inside the kettle to boil 
  d. Remove the Kettle from the outlet

4. Pour the water:
  a. Take the cup from the counter and place it on the table
  b. Pour the boiled water from the kettle half way through inside the cup
  c. Place the kettle aside on the table so others can make tea for themselves

5. Position the tea bag on the cup:
  a. Take the tea bag from the counter
  b. Position it on the cup in such a way that only half of the tea bag gets immersed

6. Add milk:
  a. Take the milk from the counter
  b. open the lid
  c. Pour the required amount inside the cup
  d. close the lid and put it aside

7. Dink:
  a. dink the tea bag in and pull it up 
  b. repeat the process until you reach the desired color of the tea

8. Cleanup after yourself:
  a. Place the milk inside the fridge and other eqipments that are no longer required at their respective places. 

~~I like drinking milk tea so it tastes differenton different color levels ranging from bright to dark.~~
